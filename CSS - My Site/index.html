        <h3>Traveling</h3>
        <p>Traveling is one of my favourite pastimes, I like to visit and experience new places. I like to travel by plane when I can. Most importantly, I like to experience new cultures and places, as well as trying their various foods.</p>

        <h3>Coding/Computing</h3>
        <p>Coding is more of a recent hobby of mine, which I discovered a passion for during my first year of college in 2016. In that time too, I developed a functioning first level of a video game in Unity, which I hope to complete in the future.

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>This is a hobby that I do every once in a while, (when I have the time to do so) I am still learning how to play the guitar, and I wouldn't mind to try out a bass guitar at some point.The type of music I like mostly consists of 60s and 70s
          music (most particularly music from The Beatles) and the indie music genre.</p>
